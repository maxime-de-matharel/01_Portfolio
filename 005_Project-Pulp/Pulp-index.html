      <p>Blacksheep (initial name of the company) was created in 2018 by 3 HEC students,
        with the aim to simplify lunch break by creating a digital menu ordering system.
        Arnaud, Olivier, and Antoine, the 3 founders, wanted to help restaurant stop losing
        customers due to the waiting time.
        <br>Eagerness is now the norm. It has become impossible to take your time. You see it every
        day: your customers are getting impatient. Some leave your facility because of the queue.
        Many will never come back.</br></p>

  <p id="paragraphe">When I arrived at Blacksheep, the product was a personalized web-app website
    deployed for each restaurant. You can visit Elgi web-app if you liked to see
    what it's look like. At the time, it was an online platform accessible to the
    customers by a QR code so that he could order when in the queue. Blacksheep would
    display print in front of and into the restaurant in order to make it more visible
    from the customers.</p>

    <p id="paragraphe">I was recruited in the aim to start designing a product according to a design

      like the charter. The main colors was a Caribbean green #00EEB2 very contrasting
      with a #000000 black.</p>

  <!-- Goals -->

  <h3 id="h3-goals">GOALS</h3>

  <p id="paragraphe">As my first mission as Product Owner, I had to understand our
    users needs and define the High Expectation Customer so that we focus on the needs
    of peoples that really need the product. 
    As I interviewed around 10 recurrent users, and identified that they wanted to
    have an app where they could find all the restaurant where they could use the solution,
    my second mission was to propose a design for a B2C application.
    Once a design proposed, I was in charge to organized development sprint and,
    in the same time the acquisition of new users and arrange the beta launch of
    the new application.
    My last mission was to set up Blacksheep on the road to find product/market
    fit and define Key Performance Indicators.</p>


    <!-- Product Owner -->

    <h3 id="h3-product-owner">PRODUCT OWNER</h3>

    <p id="paragraphe">My role in the team was to organize and manage the Product
      Backlog so that the development team have all the elements they need to start
      develop the app. As Product Owner, my objective is to make concrete the vision
      of the product inspired by the founders. I am the common link between development
      teams, users, and business. I define the order in which the features will be
      developed and take the necessary orientations express in sprint objective.</p>

      <!-- Approach -->

        <h3 id="h3-approach">APPROACH</h3>

        <p id="paragraphe">I was recruited in the aim to start designing a product according to a design
            charter that a design agency did for them. Under this, you will see what looks
            like the charter. The main colors was a Caribbean green #00EEB2 very contrasting
            with a #000000 black.</p>


        <!-- Research & Result -->

        <h3 id="h3-research-result">RESEARCH & RESULTS</h3>

        <p id="paragraphe">First, I ran couples of interviews to understand our user,
          my main goals during these interviews was to define our High Expectation
          Customer, customer that are really happy with a product and that would
          get sad with they could not use the product anymore. With choose to focus
          on those customers because we believe that to create a good product and reach
          product/market fit, the product should solve a real problem. Once we define our HXC,
          we asked them how they would like to interact with the product, what was their biggest
          frustration using it and what they would like to be able to do with our product.
          <br>We also send them a survey in order to get additional insight from those who
          did not have time to realize an interview with us.
          <br>The main issue we understood from those interview and survey is that
          the user has memorized the url of the web-app, and order their meal
          while going to the restaurant or when getting out of their office.
          We also learned that the user wanted to be albe to see all the restaurant
          where they could use our web-app. The last learning with get from those
          interview is that the user was not making any differences between Blacksheep
          (our identity) and the restaurant identity, they though that the web-app
          was from the restaurant.
          <br>Once we defined the pain and frustration of our persona, I defined a
          Job To Be Done statement so that all the team have a clear idea of what
          problem we want to solve with the product.</p>

          <p id="paragraphe2">Job To Be Done statement:</p>

          <div class="JTBD statement">
            <p></p>
          </div>


          <p id="paragraphe">That is when we realize that we should create a B2C application
            so that our user could order in anyone of our restaurant in the same app,
            and by the way be more aware of our brand and identity.
            <br>As we went for a product B2C, Blacksheep needed to change name for one
            more catchy for the user. That is when Pulp came up.
            <br>Now that I knew what problem's the users are facing, I could start
            working on the solution. I started by doing couples of low-fidelity wireframe
            and test it with Olivier, CTO. Once Olivier and agreed on the structure of the
            new product, I started the mid-fidelity wireframe and then jumped to the high-fidelity
            using the colors from the new design charter (above). 
            <br>I quickly realize that the green was too much and that the contrast was failing.
            So I proposed them to use another color, which was already in the design charter but
            as a secondary color : #
            <br>Once I was finish with the MVP (below), Olivier and I ran around 20 usability
            test during the time I was there to understand how the user would interact
            with our MVP and what they would like to be able to do with it. Those interviews
            helped us to iterate on our product and prioritize the features
            in the product backlog.</p>

          </div>

          <p id="paragraphe">Since the launch of the first release in beta test,
            I continue to run some usability test, and constantly improving the product.</p>

            <p id="paragraphe">Today a new designer took my place and continue
              to iterate on the product, I am confident that Pulp will succeed and
              reach product/market fit. </p>
